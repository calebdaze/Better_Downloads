# Better_Downloads
Every computer that has ever exist has a messy downloads. Over time we download stuff and forget about them! This program is here to fix that :D

# TODO:
Make it where it's can be used on Mac, Windows, or Linux OS. So far only works for windows. \n
Make it where people can have the addition to change where what files go to.
If possible make it where it runs in the background and automatically moves stuff if it goes to the downloads file. I want it where it ain't a lot of resources tho
